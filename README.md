# A minimal build system in C++ for C/C++  

## How to use  
Example, with comments Can be found in [BUILD.cpp](/BUILD.cpp)  
For a little thing to put in your README.md to instruct users on how to build, go to [AddMe/AddToREADME.md](/AddMe/AddToREADME.md)  

## Note 
This system is NOT recommended for larger projects  
For large projects, CMake is recommended  

I got the idea from [Mate.h](https://github.com/TomasBorquez/mate.h)
