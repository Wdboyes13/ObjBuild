# A minimal build system in C++ for C/C++  
__Example, with comments Can be found in [BUILD.cpp](/BUILD.cpp)__  

## How to use  

For everything you need  
(For these to work your build script MUST be BUILD.cpp)  
Copy  
- [AddMe/MkBuild.sh](AddMe/MkBuild.sh)  
- [AddMe/MkBuild.bat](AddMe/MkBuild.bat)  
- [AddMe/ObjBuild.hpp](/AddMe/ObjBuild.hpp)  
All into the same directory as your BUILD.cpp  
Then copy everything in AddToREADME.md into your README.md  

## Note 
This system is NOT recommended for larger projects  
For large projects, CMake is recommended  

I got the idea from [Mate.h](https://github.com/TomasBorquez/mate.h)
